I would like to thank the members of my thesis committee for their help in preparation of this work -- Niles Caulder, without whom I would have been doomed to never complete it, Kimiyo Hoshi, who helped to shed new light on many of my ideas, Pamela Isley, with whom I often disagree but who inspires me to be better, Raymond Palmer, who had no small part to play in the formation of the idea, and Kent Nelson, who always had golden advice.

Special thanks are due to the friends and colleagues who made this work possible. Jimmy Olsen and Pete Ross were invaluable both as friends and as sounding boards for some of my more outlandish ideas. Jack Knight, who I met only briefly, was a major influence, and I'm glad we were able to help each other.
