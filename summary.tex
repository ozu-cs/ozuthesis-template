There has been much speculation on whether or not efficient conversion of solar light to energy will have a breakthrough which enables high efficiency, low cost, and enabling of other capabilities previously not thought possible, whether through cellular means, semiconductor based, or otherwise. This work aims to answer some of the questions surrounding these matters.
